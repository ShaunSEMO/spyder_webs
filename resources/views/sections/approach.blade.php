                <p class="about-p left">If you answered no, I don't blame you. I mean what would you need a website for🤷🏽‍♂️? Websites are only for big businesses that need to market their products or services on a large scale, right🤔? No, wrong🙅🏾‍♂️.</p>
                <p class="about-p right">A website is actually a very critical piece of anyones profile. Yes, including YOU👇🏽! Whether you are an artist, a freelancer, a young brand, a small business or just an individual looking to get hired by your dream company🏢. You need a professional website🌐 to serve as the front cover of your profile📒.</p>
                <p class="about-p left">Imagine a book without a cover😧. No matter how good the book is👌 or how interesting the story may be🤩, without a cover there's a very good chance that you won't even pick up that book🙅‍♀️. You cant't even tell what kind of book it is or what it's all about💁🏽‍♂️.</p>
                <p class="about-p right">See without a website, you are technically like a book without a cover. Nobody can tell what kind of brand, business or employee you are without a website🌐. People will have to dig deep just to discover you🙄 , which nobody would go lengths of🙅🏽‍♂️ just to know what you have to offer them.</p>
                <p class="about-p left">Hence there is Spyder Webs😀. A web development brand that can develop neat✨, professional🤵🏽  and dynamic📲 websites which communicate well with whoever you need to reach out to, completes your profile for big companies to hire you👨🏾‍🎓, or for your target market to discover you💎.</p>
